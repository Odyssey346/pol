## Where I host my instances n stuff
This is a VPS hosted on my friend's dedi in OVH Poland.
It is running on Debian 11 Bullseye, 4096MB of RAM, 2 CPU cores and 1Gb networking. Plenty for what I host

I provide these instances for not just personal use & learning system administration, but for the general public to protect anyone's privacy if they don't want it invaded by proprietary services.

Here is a list of what I host:
- [Libreddit](https://lr.odyssey346.dev) (alternative domains: https://libreddit.odyssey346.dev)
- [Invidious](https://inv.odyssey346.dev)
- [ProxiTok](https://proxitok.odyssey346.dev)
- [Quetre](https://quetre.odyssey346.dev)
- [SimplyTranslate](https://st.odyssey346.dev) (alternative domains: https://translate.odyssey346.dev)

### Also check out:
[Project Segfault](https://projectsegfau.lt) - like my project, but with a lot of others in it (including me). Kind of more professional

[PussTheCat.org](https://pussthecat.org) - a lot like my project, I actually use their Docker images for some of the services, like Quetre.
