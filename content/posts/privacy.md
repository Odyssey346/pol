## Log policy
I do not log requests, IPs or User-Agents etc. However, if I must enable it, I will, and I'll update the privacy policy as well.
## GDPR
Unless you have an account on a service, or something that you believe gives me a concept of you, I don't have a concept of who you are, so you cannot request any personal data.

Should you have an account on a service, please send me an email at [hi@odyssey346.dev](mailto:hi@odyssey346.dev), with what service your account is on and your account name.
