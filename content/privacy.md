## Log policy
I do not log requests, IPs or User-Agents etc. However, if I must enable it, I will, and I'll update the privacy policy as well.

Note: Invidious logs requests it gets/makes, however, it doesn't log any identifiable information. I can only see where the request goes, when it makes the request and the type of request.
## GDPR
Unless you have an account on a service, or something that you believe gives me a concept of you, I don't have a concept of who you are, so you cannot request any personal data.

Should you have an account on a service, please send me an email at [hi@odyssey346.dev](mailto:hi@odyssey346.dev), with what service your account is on and your account name. If it's for account deletion, please see if the service has that by default. If it doesn't, then contact me.
